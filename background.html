      <h1>Summary Document</h1>
      <p>We're currently putting together a summary background document to help people understand the complex issues at play here.  Stay tuned!  In the meantime, you can find some good information on the Two Row Wampum and the Great Law of Peace at the links below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
      <h1>The Two Row Wampum</h1>
      <p>The <a href="http://honorthetworow.org/learn-more/history/" target="_blank">Two Row Wampum</a> is a treaty initially established between the Haudenosaunee and Dutch settlers in 1613.  Its principles were later extended to the fledgling United States.  It commits to non-interference in one another's governance affairs while proceeding in relationships of peace and friendship.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
      <h1>The Great Law of Peace</h1>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.skanonhcenter.org/site-history" target="_blank">Great Law of Peace</a> is essentially the constitution of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.</p>

      <h1>Notes on Pronunciation</h1>
      <p class="nonfinalp">The Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; language is very different than English, and each of the markers/diacritics used in writing Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; words has a specific and important effect on pronunciation.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Vowels:  The letter "i" represents the sound in "see"; "e" is similar to the sound in "say"; "a" is similar to "saw"; and "o" is similar to "so."  The vowels "&#281;" and "&#491;" are <em>nasalized</em>, which means air flows through the nose.  This is the same way consonants like "n" are made, so "&#281;" sounds something like the vowel in "ten" and "&#491;" sounds something like "tone."</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Underlined vowels:  These vowels are <em>devoiced</em>, which basically means they're silent.  This means that Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; is pronounced more like guy-oh-KO-no than guy-oh-go-HO-no.  You can almost imagine the underlined vowel isn't there, but everything around it still is: gayog-ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311;.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Accents and colons:  An acute accent means that a vowel is pronounced with a higher pitch, and a colon means that the vowel before it is long or slow.  In English, pitch and length are both signals of stressed syllables, so put a little emphasis on syllables where you see these markers.</p>
      <p>The glottal stop:  Glottal stops are a kind of sound that are only marginally present in English, but very common in Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311;.  You might see them marked variously with &#8311;, <sup>&#660;</sup>, &#794;, or with an apostrophe.  It's the same as the sound in the middle of "uh-oh" or "kitten" (unless you pronounce "kitten" with a full "t" sound or with the same sound as in the middle of "ladder").</p>

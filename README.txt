HTML codes for diacritics and special characters:
&#769; combining acute accent
&#817; combining macron below (for underlined vowels)
&#491; lowercase nasal "o"
&#490; capital nasal "o"
&#281; lowercase nasal "e"
&#280; capital nasal "e"
&#8311; glottal stop (superscript seven--I've been told by a native speaker that this is preferable to using an apostrophe or a linguistic glottal symbol, because it's supposed to have the sharp angle)

alternatively for the nasal vowels, you could use regular "o"s and "e"s with a combining ogonek, which is &#808;

words:
Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; OR Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:no&#808;&#8311;

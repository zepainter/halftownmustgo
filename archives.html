      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>We've gathered an extensive collection of documents and records surrounding the matter of Halftown's supposed leadership, and we believe these should be publicly accessible so that people can learn about it all for themselves.  We've organized them into four pages: <a href="archives/statements-from-gayogohono-governance.html">statements from Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; governance</a>, including press conferences and letters sent to U.S. government; <a href="archives/interviews-with-gayogohono-people.html">interviews with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people</a> recorded in August 2021; <a href="archives/local-us-government-statements.html">statements from the local governments of U.S. towns and cities</a> in the area; and <a href="archives/legal-documents.html">legal documents</a>, including a 2011 decision by the BIA to acknowledge Halftown's removal.  You can find quick summaries of all documents below and follow the links to see them yourself.  We've also gathered several news articles that offer relatively accurate and complete information.</p>

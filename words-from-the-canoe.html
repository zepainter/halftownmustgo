      <p class="nonfinalp">In April 2021, Halftown issued eviction notices to traditional Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens from their homes in their traditional territory and began harassing them with his illegitimate non-Cayuga police force.  In May, the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs responded with this letter.  This is the letter we're talking about when we say #ReadTheLetter.

        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:03.120,0:00:09.280<br>So for somebody who hasn't heard anything about what's been going on</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:09.280,0:00:13.360<br>between you guys and Clint Halftown could you summarize that situation</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:14.160,0:00:17.760<br>and how it relates to the march that happened today? OK. How much time you got?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:21.680,0:00:23.360<br>Start wherever you feel comfortable.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:26.080,0:00:29.840<br>Okay I'll give you a Reader's Digest version of what happened.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:30.960,0:00:37.280<br>My uncle, who was chief at the time back in the late 90s, got sick,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:38.800,0:00:44.240<br>and he appointed some people to be representatives of their clan,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:44.240,0:00:51.840<br>Clint happened to be one of them for the Heron Clan, Chuck was another one, and anyway, I</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:51.840,0:00:57.840<br>missed that meeting so I wasn't able to get the Bear Clan representative, and I found that out later.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:59.200,0:01:05.440<br>So what happened was that his mother, who was secretary at the time, wrote a little letter saying that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:06.480,0:01:11.120<br>they needed to have a representative for the Nation, and Clint went and took that letter and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:11.120,0:01:16.080<br>asked the other guys, the representatives, to sign it, they all signed it, he was only</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:16.080,0:01:21.280<br>supposed to be a contact from what I understand, but then they put in "Federal Representative."</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:24.000,0:01:31.440<br>And the last line said "to deal with all 
        governments," and that's not what was signed the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:31.440,0:01:37.680<br>first time. That's what was given to the government, and the government from that point on has recognized</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:37.680,0:01:43.280<br>Clint Halftown as a federal rep for the Cayuga Nation and we fought that, we've been fighting it for--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:44.640,0:01:53.520<br>since 2005 anyway. When Chuck and I became chiefs, what we wanted to do was take</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:53.520,0:01:59.680<br>that title away because we know that it's bad, and that's not what we're all about.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:00.960,0:02:04.960<br>My uncle was just a point of contact to sign a check so that we could have an office;</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:06.000,0:02:09.840<br>there would be all kinds of information for all the rest of our people to come to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:09.840,0:02:14.560<br>and gather information about who they are, what they are, and where we come from, and whatnot--the whole</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:14.560,0:02:22.880<br>history. But after he became representative that stopped. Now it was a matter of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:22.880,0:02:29.920<br>fighting what they were trying to tell people what the truth is, and we've been doing</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:29.920,0:02:37.840<br>that for a lot of years now, and he continues to tell the lies. He's trying</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:37.840,0:02:43.920<br>to say there's no Chiefs and Clanmothers, and that his aunt is the only Clanmother,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:45.920,0:02:52.400<br>which I couldn't believe when I read that, I saw that, anyway. So it's been an internal</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:52.400,0:02:59.520<br>dispute for many years, the traditional leadership against what</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:59.520,0:03:06.560<br>we call now a domestic terrorist, because of what he did to our community back in February of 2020;</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:08.720,0:03:12.080<br>that was caused by the government also,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:13.520,0:03:19.760<br>because Tara Sweeney who was Assistant Secretary of the Interior at the time</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:20.880,0:03:24.880<br>wrote a letter that backed up Michael Black who was the Interior before him,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:26.400,0:03:33.360<br>but her wording was that--the wording that got him to do what he did was,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:35.120,0:03:40.320<br>he has "all," in big black letters, the power to do whatever he needs to do.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:42.800,0:03:49.200<br>That caused him to do what he did. That's what he's using; he's using all kinds of lies about</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:49.200,0:03:53.920<br>the people themselves you know, and trying to justify himself, but it's not going to happen,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:54.880,0:04:00.320<br>he's already done the damage. Now he's going to have to go pretty soon, the government</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:00.320,0:04:08.240<br>asked for some investigation, the Supervisors here asked the same thing,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:10.240,0:04:14.800<br>that was in 2020. Everybody was against him, didn't understand how he could do that to his people.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:16.080,0:04:21.840<br>The chiefs got together and we made a statement, a press release, a week later saying that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:22.880,0:04:30.640<br>we don't do that to our people; we don't treat our people that way. So we declared that his</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:30.640,0:04:36.400<br>Cayuga Nation of New York is no longer an entity, and that anything and everything that anybody does</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:36.400,0:04:43.280<br>from this point on, if it doesn't have our name on it, it's not true.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:43.280,0:04:44.080<br>And what name is that?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:44.080,0:04:52.160<br>Our name is Chief's Council of the Cayuga Nation. And we have seven signatures on two papers so far,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:54.000,0:04:59.680<br>and we're going to be presenting those to the legislature tonight again to clarify,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:59.680,0:05:06.640<br>to tell the truth again, because he's still telling lies and how he's the voice of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:06.640,0:05:10.640<br>the Nation and he's the only Nation--he's not even a Nation member anymore according to us.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:11.600,0:05:19.200<br>He's committed treason. He's committed a terrorist act against his own people, and he's no longer</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:19.200,0:05:24.560<br>inside our circle. That's how we presented it in our press release and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:25.840,0:05:31.360<br>the announcement we just made about a month or so ago. So that's where it stands, since that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:31.360,0:05:37.440<br>point he's still trying to spend all our money as much as he can, because that's what</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:37.440,0:05:42.560<br>he's been doing is spending our Nation money on whatever he wants to do or she wants to do,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:43.440,0:05:51.920<br>when I say "she" I mean his mother. So that's where we're at right now. Hopefully the government will</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:51.920,0:05:58.800<br>do something other than what they've already done, by taking that title away from him.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:00.560,0:06:04.240<br>I'm still looking for somebody to do something about the funding that he's spent,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:04.960,0:06:09.120<br>the misappropriation of funds, whatever you want to call it, whatever the worst</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:10.160,0:06:12.080<br>case can be against him, with their money.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:13.920,0:06:20.560<br>Because he certainly has destroyed a lot of things with it. He's a sick man.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:20.560,0:06:25.120<br>Would it be all right with you if I took my mask off so that people watching the video can see what I'm saying?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:25.120,0:06:25.686<br>Sure.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:26.019,0:06:29.360<br>Thank you.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:29.360,0:06:33.760<br>So I'm just gonna ask a couple more specific questions based on some of the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:33.760,0:06:40.880<br>stuff that came up in there. So, and for these, more just like, I don't know, specific</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:40.880,0:06:47.840<br>questions with specific answers. So how did Clint Halftown come to power and when did that happen?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:52.480,0:06:56.880<br>Two-thousand...late 2003, early 2004,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:58.160,0:07:05.120<br>when that letter was sent in to the BIA recognizing him as a federal rep. That's when it started. And who signed that letter?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:07.527,0:07:13.840<br>Sharon Halftown, his mother, Secretary of the Nation, supposedly.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:13.840,0:07:19.840<br>And in the 20 or so years that Clint Halftown has been in his position has the United States</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:19.840,0:07:26.080<br>government given you the opportunity to have democratic say over a change in leadership?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:27.600,0:07:35.120<br>Once--any time you send a piece of paper in, because what happened was that we had a Grand Council on the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:35.120,0:07:42.080<br>same thing that was going on and Grand Council said, We're not going to let this happen again,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:42.080,0:07:47.680<br>because it happened in Oneida before this. So they said they weren't going to let it happen again so</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:47.680,0:07:52.800<br>they wrote a letter, we're going to go down to BIA, explain everything that happened, who's the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:52.800,0:08:00.480<br>people that we contacted with, and that's the way it was going to be. And at the end of that meeting,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:01.680,0:08:05.040<br>there was a line that somebody said, Well where's the paperwork?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:06.240,0:08:09.200<br>So ever since then we've been creating that paper trail.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:10.640,0:08:14.240<br>Anyone can find out how we've been trying to fight him for the last 20 years.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:15.680,0:08:23.600<br>Once, I think it was in 2015, there was a guy named Keel who happened to be at the BIA office and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:23.600,0:08:30.880<br>he decided to recognize us because of what the Clanmothers had said at that time.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:32.880,0:08:41.600<br>And as soon as he said that, he disappeared from the office, and Clint Halftown again,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:41.600,0:08:46.800<br>his appeal won, got back his recognition, from the other, the one that took his place.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:50.000,0:08:56.080<br>In that 20 years how has he used your people's money without your consent?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:58.000,0:09:05.520<br>Well in two-thousand, I think it was early 2006, the five of us got together, the two Herons, two Bears, and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:06.080,0:09:11.840<br>two Turtles--well, not two Herons, but one of the Herons--two</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:11.840,0:09:16.240<br>Bears and two Turtles, because that's all we had at the time, signed the paper,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:18.480,0:09:25.440<br>sent it in to the government that he is no longer whatever he basically called himself, and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:25.440,0:09:31.280<br>that lasted about two weeks and then the two Turtle representatives--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:33.680,0:09:38.400<br>how I say it is that they were bought: Clint gave them $150,000</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:38.400,0:09:43.440<br>and said, Hey you want to take back your words, you don't want to be--if you come and join me, I'll give you more money.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:45.040,0:09:48.400<br>And that's what they were after, so that's where they went, and then that whole thing was thrown,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:49.120,0:09:56.960<br>again, back to Clint Halftown. You mentioned something that had happened in February of last</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:09:56.960,0:10:03.840<br>year, would you be comfortable going into more detail about what happened then?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:06.000,0:10:12.880<br>Well we were--Friday we all did what we always do, we had our class, we had our food,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:14.400,0:10:21.760<br>nothing seemed to be disturbing except for you know there was a couple of people that didn't</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:21.760,0:10:27.200<br>want to be a part of us anymore, and they were raising a little heck, but it was nothing serious.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:28.880,0:10:32.800<br>So we left Friday, thinking you know,
        everything's going to be OK,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:34.480,0:10:38.960<br>and I get a call at 3:30 or 4:30 in the morning that he's tearing down the buildings.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:38.960,0:10:44.160<br>And I didn't know what the heck
        that meant until the next day. What did it mean?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:44.160,0:10:52.152<br>He tore all the buildings--he tore our schoolhouse down, the day-care center, the seven, the six cabins that we had back there--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:10:52.886,0:11:00.000<br>well there was seven, but only six were being used for people--and the store, the gas station,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:00.000,0:11:06.720<br>across the street was a Sugar Shack (a little putt-putt that sold ice cream) and what used to be a</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:06.720,0:11:13.440<br>cannery, but we turned it into a place where people can go and eat, like a kitchen.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:14.007,0:11:20.480<br>So he tore all those buildings down, and some of the guys, one of the guys here,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:21.760,0:11:28.800<br>I don't know if he'll say anything, but one of the guys that was watching was on duty for night watch,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:29.920,0:11:35.440<br>and he was waking up with a gun pointed to his head, told to get out of the truck. He was zip-tied.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:35.440,0:11:39.200<br>He was taken over to a van where everybody else was, there were two other guys there</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:40.000,0:11:43.440<br>in the same situation. They all woke up to the gun to their head</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:44.800,0:11:50.080<br>and zip-tied and put in to watch the destruction of the buildings that were going on.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:52.160,0:11:53.680<br>So within the days after that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:55.760,0:11:56.260<br>he had--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:11:58.400,0:12:04.720<br>according to the town, he hadn't gotten a permit to do that, to do the destruction of the buildings,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:06.400,0:12:09.840<br>so he has, he has other people working for him that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:12.160,0:12:16.002<br>can go get these permits that they want now for cleanup, so they went and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:16.640,0:12:21.520<br>sent her over there to get the permits. From who? From the town. And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:23.040,0:12:27.360<br>that's when they cleared out all the buildings; they just put them in dumpsters. They destroyed</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:27.360,0:12:32.640<br>our garden. I think they destroyed our chicken coop, our pigs, we had some pigs back there.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:34.400,0:12:38.320<br>We had planted some trees--I don't know if they're all gone, but</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:38.960,0:12:42.480<br>we had planted some peach trees, apple trees. I think the apple trees are gone.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:43.920,0:12:48.400<br>But they wiped out everything, everything's gone except for the main building, that's the white</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:48.400,0:12:55.120<br>building over there--we call it the boathouse. We were turning that into a day care when this happened,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:12:56.880,0:13:02.800<br>so it's still there. And the other two buildings across the street, he doesn't</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:02.800,0:13:09.200<br>bother cleaning them up, because he wants them to be there to remind people of what he can do.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:10.240,0:13:12.320<br>What have those demolitions meant for the community?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:13.360,0:13:19.840<br>Well first of all, that's where we all met, right? That was our home, that was our life at the time.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:21.440,0:13:28.000<br>And with no place to go, no job to go to, no--nothing to do for the day or whatever that we did,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:28.000,0:13:34.080<br>we had classes, we all went to classes and took care of that garden, we took care of our cornfield,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:34.080,0:13:42.922<br>pigs, chickens, we did those things 
        up on a daily basis. Oh, with all that gone, where do we go?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:43.520,0:13:47.840<br>So everybody's been, I would say, devastated from what happened.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:48.480,0:13:57.440<br>He really put, he hurt people rather than help them. That's why they were yelling that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:13:57.440,0:14:04.320<br>thing about, you know, he doesn't care about children. So, since then it's been a struggle</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:06.160,0:14:10.480<br>for the community to come together to work together. For a little while after that there</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:10.480,0:14:17.600<br>were people helping us to maintain food for everybody and cooking meals for everybody still, so.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:20.000,0:14:23.280<br>But it's been a rough, it's been rough going back to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:25.360,0:14:29.440<br>having to deal with a domestic terrorist, that's what I call him.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:32.000,0:14:36.800<br>How has that manifested since February of last year? I understand that folks have been</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:36.800,0:14:42.960<br>camping out, worrying about possible evictions. That started with the evictions back in March, I believe it was.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:42.960,0:14:50.720<br>Of this year? I think it was this year, yeah. And you start with the evictions,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:50.720,0:14:53.840<br>and people said, What the heck is this all about? And I said,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:14:53.840,0:14:58.000<br>Well he's done this three times, two times, before, and he lost both times. He doesn't have any jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:00.400,0:15:05.520<br>Don't take any of the papers, and if we don't take them, we don't--we don't acknowledge</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:05.520,0:15:11.920<br>that court system anyways because that in itself was--that's part of that money that you</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:11.920,0:15:17.600<br>were talking about earlier. Yeah. He bought himself a police department; he bought himself a judge, a</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:17.600,0:15:26.160<br>prosecutor, and a defender from what I understand, and a jail. Wow! Yeah. So he's been spending a lot</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:26.160,0:15:34.066<br>of our money on--oh yeah, and he bought them all new vehicles. So, what's that, $50,000 a piece? At least.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:35.760,0:15:41.641<br>So those are some of the things that we see him spending our money on that we don't get any part of.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:42.160,0:15:47.920<br>There was an interaction today between the marchers and a local police force. Was that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:47.920,0:15:50.016<br>his police force that you just spoke about?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:50.116,0:15:55.120<br>The ones that were on the side of the road with the black and-white cars? No, those are town cops.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:15:56.720,0:16:00.720<br>The fake police were the ones on the corner down there on the right-hand side protecting their</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:00.720,0:16:05.120<br>store down there. With the red letters on their cars? They can't do nothing. They can't do anything.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:05.120,0:16:11.520<br>They're just bodyguards, or store guards, that's how we call them. How many of them are there? Thirteen, last I knew.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:12.480,0:16:18.800<br>And none of them are Indigenous.
        They're all ex-state troopers, city cops,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:19.920,0:16:25.360<br>sheriffs. And are those the ones who were involved in the demolitions last year, in</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:25.360,0:16:30.160<br>the evictions this year? Oh yeah, definitely. They were given orders to clear out everybody, tie up everybody,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:32.000,0:16:35.840<br>make sure nobody was inside the buildings because they were going to be destroyed.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:36.720,0:16:42.560<br>We do have video on them coming in to the store with guns drawn.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:43.760,0:16:49.680<br>I don't know if you've ever seen these shows on TV where the cops come in with their guns</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:49.680,0:16:56.480<br>drawn, you know, trying to find somebody and make sure they don't get shot first. And a week after</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:16:56.480,0:17:05.992<br>that one of their lawyers said, Oh no there was no guns involved. And so we showed them the video, and they shut up about that.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:09.680,0:17:17.840<br>So I'm going to change directions of questioning a little bit.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:18.640,0:17:21.920<br>There was a banner that was held at the front of the march today</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:21.920,0:17:26.960<br>that said Remember the Children. What does that mean to you in the context of this march?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:29.040,0:17:34.720<br>That's a reminder of all the--of what happened to our ancestors,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:36.400,0:17:39.200<br>how the children were taken away from the families back then.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:41.600,0:17:48.320<br>From what I understand from Carlisle, the guys that took them--take the Indian out and save the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:48.320,0:17:56.400<br>man. And that's what they've been trying to do. But then I saw another video, Unseen Tears,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:17:56.400,0:18:00.880<br>with a couple of elders on there, talking about when they were there and what happened to them.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:02.560,0:18:07.440<br>And it's a sad, very sad story about the abuse that they had to go through.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:08.880,0:18:13.360<br>And it makes me angry at the nuns now and the preachers and everybody else that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:13.360,0:18:18.000<br>had anything to do with that. They're all trying to say that they were doing it for the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:19.280,0:18:22.560<br>right way to live.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:22.702,0:18:38.217<br>So what they found was, the first 215, it's a reminder that there's a lot more to be found that were taken away, and never made it to anything.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:39.280,0:18:43.120<br>They probably didn't even get to speak their language because they were taken at a young age.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:45.280,0:18:53.120<br>From your perspective, how does what happened with the residential schools connect to what's happened</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:18:53.120,0:18:59.360<br>with Clint Halftown in the last 20 years and the United States government's involvement in that?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:00.080,0:19:05.520<br>Same thing, nothing's changed much. BIA still has to do their assimilation, whatever they can do to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:05.520,0:19:12.560<br>assimilate people. Right now they're using Clint Halftown to do that, and because of Clint Halftown's</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:12.560,0:19:17.520<br>damage by the residential schools, he doesn't know any better, and she don't know any better either, so</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:18.800,0:19:25.360<br>this is what they believe, they probably believe this is the right way to go. And now they got all</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:25.360,0:19:32.800<br>that money, and, from what I understand--I had $500 in my pocket one time, and I felt really powerful.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:34.240,0:19:46.018<br>I could buy many friends that way, you know? Then I said, Oh, so that's what happened to them. They're sick. They've got all that money, and have</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:46.051,0:19:51.457<br>control of it, and now they can do whatever they want to do. So they think.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:51.520,0:19:56.640<br>So they try to do the same thing here. We're a Nation that was scattered anyway</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:19:56.640,0:20:05.840<br>from the beginning, I forgot to tell you that part about us. We're the only nation that doesn't have a</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:09.600,0:20:14.320<br>a regular reservation, you know, where it's outlined, This is where your reservation is. We don't have</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:14.320,0:20:21.840<br>that. The Canandaigua Treaty gives us 
        reservation status and gives us 64,000 acres--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:22.800,0:20:26.160<br>44 on this side and 20 on that side of the northern end of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:26.160,0:20:29.840<br>the lake, but doesn't go all the way to the northern end of the lake.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:32.560,0:20:38.000<br>So it's always been a question of mine of who made those lines. Why did they only give</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:38.000,0:20:47.840<br>us that much, and again, who made the lines, but like anything else, it's a matter of assimilation, right?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:50.800,0:20:52.480<br>So we do have reservation status.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:54.560,0:20:57.440<br>Clint Halftown has a reservation. I see.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:20:58.880,0:21:01.120<br>We laugh at that too, because it's only two houses.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:04.160,0:21:10.320<br>There was a lot of chanting today that Clint Halftown has to go. Oh definitely. What needs to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:10.320,0:21:18.240<br>happen next in order for that to happen? What needs to happen next is that the government has to step up and do their part on</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:20.800,0:21:23.520<br>turning this around before something else really happens.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:25.200,0:21:32.080<br>And it's not going to be good. Have they shown any interest in hearing? The Justice Department, from</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:32.080,0:21:36.240<br>what I understand today, the Justice Department did not know anything about this.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:37.840,0:21:45.040<br>So that tells me the new Secretary of the Interior doesn't know about it. The new guy who just got</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:45.040,0:21:52.080<br>in to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior doesn't know about it. The head of the BIA does</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:52.080,0:21:56.240<br>know about it, but can't do anything about it until he gets an OK from the other two.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:21:57.200,0:22:03.360<br>So that's how I guess it works, but we are making them aware. There's things that happen.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:04.800,0:22:09.680<br>We do have some paperwork that we can send in; we have some videos that we can send in;</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:09.680,0:22:16.160<br>we have declarations that we can send in. And yeah, we're looking for him to be gone.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:19.600,0:22:27.360<br>If I can editorialize for a second, I've noticed that you've spoken a lot about--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:27.360,0:22:31.920<br>knowledge about the structure of the federal and state governments of the United States here; has</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:31.920,0:22:37.040<br>that same sort of interest and understanding of governmental structure been extended to you</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:37.040,0:22:42.080<br>guys? Do they understand how decisions are made and just choose to ignore them, or do they just</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:42.080,0:22:47.760<br>not understand how decisions are made? They have knowledge of our way because we've been sending</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:47.760,0:22:51.920<br>papers for the last 20 years telling them who we are, and what we are, and why we are,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:52.880,0:22:58.880<br>and how we became chiefs, and how our government works, and all they had to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:22:58.880,0:23:07.840<br>do was to look into that. But if they do that, then that means that they made a mistake. Right.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:08.560,0:23:12.080<br>Somebody had pointed that out to me, and I just said, Well,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:12.080,0:23:17.280<br>why don't they just correct it? Well it's been 20 years--what do you think's going</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:17.280,0:23:23.360<br>to happen to the BIA office? Why should we be there anyway? It needs to go, just like him.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:29.360,0:23:35.840<br>What can people who live nearby and maybe watch or listen to this do from where they are that would</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:35.840,0:23:42.240<br>be the most helpful for you? I've been asked that question ever since I've been here, since 2014.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:44.480,0:23:47.760<br>To make people aware there's different groups that happen, you know.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:49.520,0:23:54.160<br>There's Catholic Charities, I guess, from Ithaca, they had signed a letter and had people sign it themselves</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:54.160,0:23:59.520<br>to send it in to the government, get a hold of your congressman, get a hold of your legislatures,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:23:59.520,0:24:05.200<br>get a hold of anybody that has a title, let them know what's going on and how you're not</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:05.920,0:24:14.240<br>happy about it, even though they may--it may someday be a better thing to do for everybody.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:16.720,0:24:23.360<br>But like that lady said out there I heard, "I pay my taxes why don't you pay yours?" Well,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:23.360,0:24:28.560<br>see the difference between us and them is that they have to because they don't know any better.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:29.840,0:24:37.280<br>Right? We don't. We know better. If you were to pay those taxes would you see anything</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:37.280,0:24:43.280<br>come back to you from that? No, I don't, no. That's not what's going to happen.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:44.240,0:24:50.000<br>We can help them out, we can pay for our electric, we can pay for our water, but</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:51.440,0:24:55.840<br>no, we're not going to pay no taxes. We don't pay taxes. That's what all the treaties are</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:24:55.840,0:25:01.680<br>about. We've been trying 20 years of--treaty, telling them about treaties, the Two Row,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:01.680,0:25:09.280<br>the Gasw&#281;nta&#8311; and the friendship. All these treaties that were made, all saying the same thing:</p> <!--uncertain Gyg word-->
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:11.680,0:25:17.840<br>as long as the grass is green, the water flows, and the sun shines. They all say the same thing.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:20.400,0:25:23.440<br>And they haven't, and they've ignored every single one of them.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:23.440,0:25:27.840<br>But we keep reminding them of the Two Row, and that's what's been working so far.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:30.240,0:25:35.040<br>Is there anything else that you'd like to let people know about, or any other history</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:35.040,0:25:40.005<br>details that you'd like to fill in to help people understand the story?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:40.005,0:25:45.040<br>Well, like I said, I've been around the lake a couple times and now I keep saying this over and over, and--I haven't</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:45.040,0:25:51.200<br>seen the map yet--I only saw it once, where our original territory is, from Lake Ontario</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:52.080,0:25:58.960<br>on down both sides of the lake, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio was our original territory.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:25:58.960,0:26:03.120<br>The ones around the lake are starting to acknowledge that part that they're on our territory.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:05.920,0:26:11.236<br>And our lawyer says, "well that's not the Canandaigua Treaty." I say that doesn't matter. It's still our territory.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:11.236,0:26:17.760<br>What have those acknowledgements meant for you? I think it means that some people are paying attention</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:18.400,0:26:25.360<br>and want change. They want to be part of the good things that are happening. They want to be part of that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:27.120,0:26:30.400<br>because they're sick and tired of that
        salt mine down there and some of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:30.400,0:26:33.600<br>these farmers dumping their stuff into the lakes, damaging the water.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:37.120,0:26:40.932<br>I think that's everything I can think of. Is there anything else I should cover? There's one more thing, which is,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:40.960,0:26:47.405<br>it's funny to do it right now, but could you just introduce yourself and your title?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:49.040,0:26:51.840<br>I was born in 1952.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:53.520,0:26:58.320<br>I was given the English name, or sometimes called the slave name, of Sam George.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:26:58.320,0:26:59.920<br>
        0:26:59.920,0:27:07.440<br>In 2004, my Clanmother came to me and said, "You're next." That's after my uncle passed away.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:09.280,0:27:14.480<br>And I tried to get out of it, but soon--people say when your Clanmother tells me you're next, you're</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:14.480,0:27:22.880<br>next. So from that point on, I got recognized at the Tonawanda Reservation, because that's how the</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:22.880,0:27:27.840<br>system works: you get recognized, everybody comes from all different nations to come and greet you,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:29.200,0:27:33.840<br>and then you send it over to the other side, the older brothers,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:36.240,0:27:38.880<br>for getting a Condolence, being put in,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:40.560,0:27:53.840<br>put in place and given a title. My uncle's title is  Shoy&#491;:we:s.  Shoy&#491;:we:s means "pulling guts." I found</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:27:53.840,0:27:59.120<br>that story, I heard that story a couple of years later after that, why it means pulling guts. And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:00.960,0:28:04.640<br>they said back when the Peacemaker came up from the south end of the lake</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:05.360,0:28:11.040<br>in this canoe that they were in, he saw these fishermen on the side of the lake and he wanted to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:11.040,0:28:16.800<br>know what they were doing. So they rode over there, and what they saw was one guy, the first</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:16.800,0:28:25.600<br>guy was taking the fish, hitting him on the head. I think that's the title that he carries. Then</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:25.600,0:28:33.360<br>he hands it to me, and I pull out the guts--that's  Shoy&#491;:we:s. I hand him to the next one and that's--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:33.360,0:28:41.440<br>he puts him on the pole to dry out. That's his title name, too. I asked how to say that</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:41.440,0:28:48.000<br>I can't say it right now, because I only know mine for sure, so that's the title I have today.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:51.120,0:28:54.160<br>That title's been here time, time immemorial.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:28:57.280,0:29:00.560<br>But that's it. If you want to know I just say Hoya:neh Shoy&#491;:we:s</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:29:03.040,0:29:06.080<br>when it comes time to introduce myself to anybody else.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:29:08.080,0:29:14.960<br>All that means is that, from what my teacher says, it's, Here's a good person who pulls guts.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:29:17.360,0:29:21.120<br>So hang onto yours, I may be pulling yours next!</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:29:23.760,0:29:25.840<br>Thank you. Nya:w&#281;h. Da:ne&#8311;toh.</p> <!--uncertain Gyg word-->

        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:24.034,0:00:36.034<br>Hi. My name is Teresa Longboat John. I'm of the Turtle Clan, the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:38.034,0:00:49.034<br>And I'm just here because I feel there needs to be a face to let everybody know</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:52.034,0:00:52.700<br>who</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:55.034,0:01:03.034<br>we're asking you to help and to protect us from the Halftown faction.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:03.034,0:01:04.034<br>And I believe that it's important for us to get out there and show our face, and share a little</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:14.034,0:01:23.034<br>bit of our story--not the whole thing, but just a little bit of our story--with you to explain to you</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:25.034,0:01:34.034<br>why we're up here, how we got up here, and why we continue the fight.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:36.034,0:01:39.034<br>I came up with my son in 2010,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:42.034,0:01:43.034<br>and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:46.034,0:01:52.034<br>it was nice. It was amazing to be up here in our homeland.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:56.034,0:01:59.034<br>For me, it was my ma's dream come true,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:00.034,0:02:07.034<br>because she told us to get to our homeland when it was</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:09.034,0:02:10.034<br>available to come to us.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:13.034,0:02:19.034<br>So I came with my son. My son came first, and then I came</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:20.034,0:02:30.034<br>like a month later. And at the time, I was the eldest.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:32.034,0:02:36.034<br>And we all worked. We all worked,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:38.034,0:02:39.034<br>lesser wages,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:42.034,0:02:48.034<br>but to me it was just the idea that I was up here on my own land, my own house,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:52.034,0:02:58.034<br>and it was amazing. It was just amazing. I live on the lake,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:01.034,0:03:02.034<br>and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:05.034,0:03:08.034<br>I just wanted to give a little bit of history of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:11.034,0:03:13.034<br>how I was brought up in</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:17.034,0:03:24.034<br>the whole Cayuga Nation, I should say.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:24.034,0:03:32.034<br>At 16, I started¬†</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">attending meetings with my mom, because</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:32.034,0:03:37.067<br>she said it was very important for me to learn what was going on with my Nation.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:40.034,0:03:44.034<br>So at 16, I started learning</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:46.034,0:03:56.034<br>about what was happening and everything, and the fight--the fight then to hear from Clint Halftown</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:58.034,0:03:59.034<br>and Tim Twoguns</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:02.034,0:04:08.034<br>what was happening.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:22.034,0:04:28.034<br>Hi Buzz! Hello! My son Buzz from work.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:31.034,0:04:35.034<br>But yeah. And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:36.034,0:04:42.033<br>so we've been fighting for a long time, with me being an elder now,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:45.033,0:04:47.033<br>and what is very important to me</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:48.033,0:05:05.033<br>is, I don't want my children to fight, and I don't want my grandson to fight.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:05.033,0:05:08.033<br>And that's all they're seeing,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:10.033,0:05:15.033<br>is just all this fighting.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:16.033,0:05:24.033<br>For us it's about the land, the land and our children, because we have that posterity.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:27.033,0:05:33.033<br>Clint Halftown doesn't have any; he doesn't have any lineage to carry on.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:34.033,0:05:46.033<br>And for him it's all about greed, and it's all about the money.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:47.033,0:05:48.033<br>And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:51.033,0:05:53.333<br>as far as our homes go?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:55.033,0:05:57.131<br>That comes with that settlement.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:58.033,0:06:05.033<br>That settlement that he said all the Cayugas voted on, to let him handle.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:08.033,0:06:10.033<br>Well.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:11.033,0:06:20.033<br>Cayuga people--this is how he's handling it. And he bulldozed down a store, a day care,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:21.033,0:06:32.033<br>a schoolhouse that brought the language and the traditional ways back, the gardens that supplied food.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:34.033,0:06:44.033<br>And people were employed, and we were living in peace. We did not go out of our way to harass him.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:48.033,0:06:50.033<br>And then this was all done,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:52.033,0:06:54.033<br>starting at two o'clock in the morning.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:56.033,0:07:03.033<br>And I was away on vacation, and I came back to this--and I live right next door to this!</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:04.033,0:07:10.033<br>And that's what I see every day. Every day I see it.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:13.033,0:07:17.033<br>We get drive-bys by his illegal,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:20.033,0:07:29.033<br>fake police force. We get papers by his illegal police force.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:32.033,0:07:39.033<br>We get followed by his illegal police force.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:39.033,0:07:46.033<br>And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:49.033,0:07:52.033<br>it's got to stop; it's got to stop.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:55.033,0:07:58.033<br>He's got to stop. His mother's got to stop.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:03.033,0:08:08.033<br>It's driving the people all apart. And we</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:11.033,0:08:25.033<br>can be, should be, we want to be very strong together, united as one, as it should be.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:31.033,0:08:34.033<br>And it's for the children.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:35.033,0:08:40.033<br>Oh! It's for the children. It's for our generations to come.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:45.033,0:08:49.033<br>So if you can, please share this.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:51.033,0:08:53.033<br>I would appreciate it.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:08:55.033,0:09:02.033<br>And once again, I would like to thank everybody that's helped us--the campers that have come out.</p>
        <p>0:09:04.033,0:09:15.033<br>We have received donations from people, different tribes.</p>

      <div class="transcript">
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:25.092,0:00:30.131<br>My name is Judy Jimerson. I live</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:32.600,0:00:42.943<br>here in Cayuga Lake. I'm a Cayuga, Cayuga
        Bear. I'm from Six Nations in Canada.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:00:46.647,0:00:58.692<br>And I came here 7 years ago, when I read it in a newspaper that the Cayuga people needed help. And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:01.729,0:01:09.069<br>I came, I came for just a couple of weeks, to see if I could help, if I could be of any service,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:09.069,0:01:18.179<br>anything. And I did, I held down Union Springs for a little bit, and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:19.680,0:01:26.587<br>then they took over--Clint's goons came and took it over. And I remember that night,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:27.688,0:01:37.798<br>I remember them screaming that the Canadian Cayugas weren't real Cayugas, and that we had</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:37.798,0:01:44.171<br>no say, and we weren't supposed to be here. And we were disgusting, and we ran away, and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:44.171,0:01:50.878<br>everything like that. I remember them screaming that, and then I remember them trying to get</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:01:50.878,0:02:02.823<br>into the store and take everything back over. And I think it was Timothy Twoguns screaming</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:04.191,0:02:14.368<br>how much, like, Canadian Cayugas weren't real Cayugas, and things like that.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:14.501,0:02:20.641<br>And then the mercs came in, and they started to like swarm us--oops, sorry--they started to</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:20.641,0:02:26.013<br>like swarm us, and be like all around us, and I remember getting punched in the face by one of</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:26.013,0:02:33.387<br>them, and just like looking at him shocked that a man would punch me, and then I jumped on the ball</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:33.387,0:02:39.960<br>of men, and like tried to swim over everybody into the store. That didn't work out very well.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:41.261,0:02:48.669<br>But after I couldn't hold the front of the store, we went to the back of the store, trying to help,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:02:48.669,0:02:55.309<br>and it just fell. It was chaos from there. And then they got Union Springs back.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:00.814,0:03:09.390<br>So then I came over here to 89 after that, to see if I could help protect this store,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:09.390,0:03:12.860<br>make sure that we could--make sure that the Cayuga people could keep it,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:13.961,0:03:20.200<br>and I ended up meeting my husband and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:22.669,0:03:27.941<br>got married, and I've been here ever since. Kind of married into the fight, and</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:30.644,0:03:31.145<br>I learned</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:33.213,0:03:40.821<br>more and more about this fight every day, how</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:41.789,0:03:46.293<br>Clint's cops aren't real; they don't have</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:46.293,0:03:52.299<br>no contracts. They don't have any say or jurisdiction, and what--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:03:53.801,0:04:01.141<br>on this territory, and they're white men trying to boss around Native people. How is</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:01.141,0:04:10.417<br>that right? How is Clint hiring Native people--or, non-Native people--to boss Native people around?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:13.520,0:04:14.021<br>It's just--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:16.423,0:04:19.159<br>it just disgusts me and makes me</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:20.127,0:04:26.433<br>very angry and upset and frustrated. And I wish I could do more, and I wish I could--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:29.203,0:04:36.810<br>it's that feeling of hopelessness, of not--feeling like you're not doing enough.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:42.983,0:04:43.483<br>It just--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:45.919,0:04:50.824<br>it's overwhelming and it sucks.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:04:51.658,0:05:04.805<br>And</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:05.539,0:05:06.039<br>I don't know.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:12.012,0:05:18.819<br>I'm at a loss for words now, sorry.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:47.214,0:05:50.984<br>There's so much that's gone on, and so much that's happened, it's just--</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:05:54.187,0:06:00.460<br>it's a lot of emotions, and a lot of--a lot of crap to dig through, and I'm</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:02.996,0:06:06.533<br>trying really hard not to sit here and just bawl my eyes out.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:18.345,0:06:24.317<br>But I know one thing that could help us—Cayuga Nation, the Cayuga people,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:24.985,0:06:31.491<br>the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people--is if maybe one person could just call</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:32.692,0:06:37.798<br>and just say that this isn't right--you know, what Clint is doing.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:40.300,0:06:44.004<br>It isn't right, and it's so wrong.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:47.441,0:06:49.209<br>And it's just evil.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:06:50.744,0:06:58.585<br>How can you do this to your community members, to your people, to children?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:01.788,0:07:10.831<br>How can you do that? How can you tear down a whole community and just get away with it?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:13.733,0:07:15.702<br>How is that right in any sense?</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:21.441,0:07:25.545<br>And I just hope that one person sees this,</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:26.813,0:07:38.859<br>and just gives us one call, that might be the one thing that we need.</p>
        <p class="nonfinalp">0:07:40.760,0:07:45.632<br>Thank you. Thanks for listening.</p>

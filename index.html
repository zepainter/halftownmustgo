        <p class="nonfinalp">Clint Halftown has been removed from any representative role within the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; (Cayuga) Nation in accordance with the Nation's governing processes and the Great Law of Peace, but the US federal government continues to recognize him as the Nation's representative.  US support of Halftown is a violation of the Two Row Wampum, a treaty of non-interference between the Haudenosaunee nations ("the canoe") and settlers ("the ship") while we travel as neighbors down the same metaphorical river.</p>
        <p>It's time for the US to honor Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; self-determination by heeding the Nation's decision and ending its recognition of Halftown.  The Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs, the governing body of the Nation, has put forth calls for help from people of the US to hold our government accountable on this issue, so we're here to tell our government: Halftown Must Go.</p>

It says Join us!  We're going to DC to urge the DOI and BIA to immediately cease recognizing Clint Halftown as representative of the Gayogohono.  Sunday May 15 through Monday May 16.  From across all Haudenosaunee lands."></a>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Sunday May 15 and Monday May 16, we'll be heading from across all Haudenosaunee lands to Washington, DC.  We're planning this event in dialogue with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; titleholders and citizens, some of whom have expressed interest in attending and organizing speakers.  There will be a dynamic gathering near Department of Interior offices late morning on Monday, and we're hoping to also secure meetings with New York senators Schumer and Gillibrand's offices, all to help the US government understand that in the name of Indigenous sovereignty, Halftown Must Go.</p>
      <p>Interested in joining us or providing helpful resources?  Fill in a quick <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclCL9ndS-anCccRmVcllAZzpXGzuBeDNjtOgG8uP5LFN1Ehg/viewform" target="_blank">interest form</a> to let us know!

      <h2>Action: Postcard Flurry</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">On May 7, many of us gathered in Ithaca's Stewart Park to write postcards urging the DOI to deny Halftown's land-into-trust application and push for the President to meet with the Council of Chiefs.  It's not too late to add one more!  You can write your own message or start with the script below.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp indented">Asst. Sec. Bryan Newland<br>Department of the Interior<br>1849 C Street, N.W.<br>Washington, DC, 20240</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Dear Asst. Sec. Newland,</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">I am a US resident/citizen writing out of concern about the way we as the US are violating Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; self-determination, violating the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and enabling human rights abuses against my Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; neighbors through your continuing legitimization of Clint Halftown as a representative of the Cayuga Nation.  I ask that you prompt the President to meet with the Council of Chiefs ASAP (since they've expressed complaint as per the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua).  I want our nation-to-nation relationship to respect Haudenosaunee governance and heed the removal of Halftown.  In the meantime, please deny the pending land-into-trust application.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Thank you,</p>
      <p>[Your name], [location/ZIP code] (Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; land)</p>

      <h2>Ithaca City Letter</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Our efforts in Ithaca have paid off!  The Common Council unanimously signed a letter in support of the traditional Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; and sent it to the Secretary of the Interior and other U.S. officials. Ithaca joins the Town of Dryden, Town of Enfield, Seneca County, and Cornell University Student Assembly in sending official letters or passing resolutions on this issue.</p>
      <p>Read the letters:</p>

      <h2>Action: Rebuking Halftown's 60% Claim</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Clint Halftown is fond of claiming that 60% of Cayuga Nation citizens support him.  You can learn about <a href="faq.html#60-percent-claim">why this claim is misleading</a> and help dispel it by sharing that information with the DOI, BIA, and journalistic publications.  Here's some contact information:</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp indented"><strong>Bryan Newland</strong><br>Department of the Interior<br>1849 C Street, N.W.<br>Washington, DC, 20240</p>

      <p class="nonfinalp">You can also ask journalistic publications to acknowledge the <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/" target="_blank">Haudenosaunee Confederacy's official website</a> (which lists the Nation's <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/government/current-clan-mothers-and-chiefs/" target="_blank">current Clan Mothers and Chiefs</a>) any time their reporting discusses Halftown's supposed "leadership," and to stop using phrases like "anti-Halftown faction," as the Council of Chiefs is <strong>not</strong> a "faction," nor are the Clan Mothers, nor are the Nation citizens who acknowledge their role and authority within the Great Law of Peace.</p>
      <p>Any time you see or hear Halftown's 60% narrative, comment and share the full context!  Point people to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy's website or right here to our own to get informed and review relevant documents for themselves.</p>

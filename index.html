      <div id="headerdesc">The US federal government recognizes Clint Halftown as federal representative of the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; (Cayuga) Nation, but the nation's traditional and rightful leadership have removed Halftown from any leadership position within the nation for abuses of power.  Continued US support of Halftown is a violation of the Two Row Wampum, a treaty of non-interference between the Haudenosaunee nations ("the canoe") and Europeans ("the ship") while we travel as neighbors down the same metaphorical river.  It's time for the US to honor the decision of the Council of Chiefs and end federal recognition of Halftown.  #ReadTheLetter</div>

      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p class="nonfinalp">The idea for the #HalftownMustGo campaign was presented by two non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; participants at a Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community meeting on August 12th, 2021.  This meeting was attended by two members of the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs and various Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community members.  Because the strategy behind this campaign specifically involves using the power mechanisms of U.S. representative government, participants at the meeting agreed that the specific responsibility for organizing this page lies with settlers.  We do not speak for the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people; you can see some of what they've said for themselves <a href="words-from-the-canoe.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Since that meeting, many more non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people from around the area have since become involved in this effort.  Many are white, European-descended settlers, who grew up occupying and/or currently occupy Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; territory, and who are engaged in ongoing conversations with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people.  Several have also been part of the “solidarity camping” efforts mentioned in the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs' May 2021 letter (read it <a href="/words-from-the-canoe.html">here</a>).</p>

      <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
      <p>The #HalftownMustGo campaign began with a Week of Action aimed to organize people of the U.S. to demand the attention of particular officials within the U.S. government. Currently, we're engaged in efforts to establish local resolutions in the cities and towns around the Cayuga Lake area.  In these actions and resolutions, we insist that the U.S. government and its officials revoke federal recognition of Clint Halftown, in accordance with the calls in the Council of Chiefs' letter. This action is a strategic prong in alignment with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community organizing and diplomatic efforts to rescind U.S. federal recognition of Halftown before he mobilizes his own or settler police forces to evict traditional Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; families from their homes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
      <h1>Accountability</h1>
      <p class="nonfinalp">As the idea of the #HalftownMustGo campaign developed, participants discussed accountability in the relationships and processes around the effort. Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; and non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; participants in the initial meeting agreed on practices deemed by all present to be attentive to the nuances of cross-National collaboration, and specifically in accordance with the Two Row Wampum. This is a treaty initially established between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and Dutch settlers in 1613, and later extended to the fledgling United States. The Two Row Wampum commits to non-interference in one another's governance affairs while proceeding in relationships of peace and friendship.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="textbox">
      <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
      <p>We view U.S. federal recognition of the Council of Chiefs, instead of Halftown, both as a necessary immediate outcome and as only one step within broader processes of addressing the ongoing impacts of settler colonialism. This campaign will close after Clint Halftown is no longer recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but the organizers are committed to continuing to cultivate relationships of care with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people and to continuing the work of holding our settler governance structures accountable to the fact of Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; sovereignty.</p>

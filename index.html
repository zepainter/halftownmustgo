        <p class="nonfinalp">Clint Halftown has been removed from any representative role within the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; (Cayuga) Nation in accordance with the Nation's governing processes and the Great Law of Peace, but the US federal government continues to recognize him as the Nation's representative.  US support of Halftown is a violation of the Two Row Wampum, a treaty of non-interference between the Haudenosaunee nations ("the canoe") and settlers ("the ship") while we travel as neighbors down the same metaphorical river.</p>
        <p>It's time for the US to honor Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; self-determination by heeding the Nation's decision and ending its recognition of Halftown.  The Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs, the governing body of the Nation, has put forth calls for help from people of the US to hold our government accountable on this issue, so we're here to tell our government: Halftown Must Go.</p>

      <h2>URGENT!  Halftown has resumed demolitions, support needed!</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">On August 3rd, 2022, Cayuga Nation Police (CNP, Halftown's non-Native police) bulldozed buildings of significance to Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens who oppose him, in a sequel to the destruction he wrought in February 2020.  Among the buildings demolished: the barn where Ceremonies were being held until the longhouse destroyed in 2020 could be restored; and the home of an elder lovingly called Grandma by the community, after she was violently dragged out of it.  On September 3rd, CNP began arresting and tasing Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens and towing their cars in a likely attempt to evict them from, and possibly demolish, more homes.</p>

      <p class="nonfinalp">Support is urgently requested!  Food and supplies, donations, and on-site presence from those who know the community and the area are all helpful.  <a href="https://givebutter.com/ZgM2lT#">Donate here</a> or to @SolidarityIthaca on Venmo.

      <h2>Action: Calling on Senators Schumer and Gillibrand</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">May 31, 2022</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">We recently met with staff in Schumer and Gillibrand's offices in DC.  These meetings seemed promising, but the Senators have not yet followed up on our asks.  Allies across NY state: Call on Schumer and Gillibrand's offices now!</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp indented">Schumer's DC office: 202-224-6542<br>Gillibrand's DC office: 202-224-4451</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Let's keep attention on the NY Senators' offices so they act in time to stop the Land-into-Trust application.  Call today, call tomorrow, call every day until the senators take action!  You can join us for a Phone Zap on Thursday (6/2) at 11am and 5:30pm EDT.  We'll meet on Zoom (email us or message us through social media for the link) and take 15 minutes for questions and check-in before calling together.  Whether you join the zap or call on your own, if you're not sure what to say, you can use or adapt the script below.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp indented">"Hi, I'm a constituent in [location/zip code], calling because I want to know what Senator [Schumer/Gillibrand] is doing to stop the Halftown Council's Land-into-Trust application in the name of the Cayuga Nation and to call for Biden to meet with the Cayuga Chiefs.</p>
      <p class="indented">"Numerous municipalities within the Senator's constituency and across Cayuga homelands have passed resolutions and written letters about this issue.  I understand that your staff has received copies.  Can you tell me what actions the senator is planning to take and when, given the urgent timeline on this issue?"</p>

      <h2>DC March for Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Self-Determination</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">May 18, 2022</p>
      <img class="photo" src="lib/images/dc-umbrellas.jpg" alt="Photo of a group of people outside the White House, holding purple and white umbrellas with a message written on them that says Biden Meet The Sachems.">
      <p class="nonfinalp">Sunday May 15 and Monday May 16, Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens and allies headed down from all across Haudenosaunee lands to Washington, DC to deliver a message to the DOI and the Biden administration: it's time to stop recognizing Halftown, and meet with the Council of Chiefs instead.  We started at the DOI with an umbrella display in the colors of the Two Row Wampum that read, in big letters, "Biden Meet The Sachems."  In smaller letters around their rims, the umbrellas had the full text of the <a href="words-from-the-canoe#may-2021-letter">May 2021 letter</a> from the Council of Chiefs.  Then we marched to the White House, where some of us met with representatives from Senators Schumer's and Gillibrand's offices.  We're hopeful we made a real impression, and we'll be following up with them soon.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Many thanks to all those who contributed in any way to make this possible!</p>

      <h2>Action: Postcard Flurry</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">May 9, 2022</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">On May 7, many of us gathered in Ithaca's Stewart Park to write postcards urging the DOI to deny Halftown's land-into-trust application and push for the President to meet with the Council of Chiefs.  It's not too late to add one more!  You can write your own message or start with the script below.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp indented">Asst. Sec. Bryan Newland<br>Department of the Interior<br>1849 C Street, N.W.<br>Washington, DC, 20240</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Dear Asst. Sec. Newland,</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">I am a US resident/citizen writing out of concern about the way we as the US are violating Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; self-determination, violating the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and enabling human rights abuses against my Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; neighbors through your continuing legitimization of Clint Halftown as a representative of the Cayuga Nation.  I ask that you prompt the President to meet with the Council of Chiefs ASAP (since they've expressed complaint as per the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua).  I want our nation-to-nation relationship to respect Haudenosaunee governance and heed the removal of Halftown.  In the meantime, please deny the pending land-into-trust application.</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Thank you,</p>
      <p>[Your name], [location/ZIP code] (Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; land)</p>

      <h2>Ithaca City Letter</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">May 1, 2022</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Our efforts in Ithaca have paid off!  The Common Council unanimously signed a letter in support of the traditional Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; and sent it to the Secretary of the Interior and other U.S. officials. Ithaca joins the Town of Dryden, Town of Enfield, Seneca County, and Cornell University Student Assembly in sending official letters or passing resolutions on this issue.</p>

      <h2>Action: Rebuking Halftown's 60% Claim</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">April 20, 2022</p>
      <p class="nonfinalp">Clint Halftown is fond of claiming that 60% of Cayuga Nation citizens support him.  You can learn about <a href="faq.html#60-percent-claim">why this claim is misleading</a> and help dispel it by sharing that information with the DOI, BIA, and journalistic publications.  Here's some contact information:</p>

      <p>Any time you see or hear Halftown's 60% narrative, comment and share the full context!  Point people to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy's website or right here to our own to get informed and review relevant documents for themselves.</p>

    <div class="textbox" id="who-we-are">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">The idea for the #HalftownMustGo campaign was presented by two non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; guests at a Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community meeting on August 12th, 2021.  This meeting was attended by two members of the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; Council of Chiefs and various Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens.  Because the strategy behind this campaign specifically involves using the power mechanisms of U.S. representative government, participants at the meeting agreed that, in accordance with the Two Row Wampum, the specific responsibility for organizing this campaign lies with settlers.</p>
      <p>Many more non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people have since become involved in organizing this effort; many grew up occupying and/or currently occupy Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; territory, and are engaged in ongoing conversations with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; citizens.  We speak from our position as non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people living on Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; land.  To understand more about the experiences of Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people, you can read <a href="archives/statements-from-gayogohono-governance.html">official statements from the traditional leadership</a> or watch some <a href="archives/interviews-with-gayogohono-people.html">interviews with the community</a>.</p>

    <div class="textbox" id="our-purpose">
      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>We take collective action to prompt President Biden and his administration to meet with the Council of Sachems (Chiefs) and Clanmothers and to heed the Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; removal of Clint Halftown. As people of the United States, we aim to address our complicity in this present day form of colonial violence. We do this work in dialgoue and alignment with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; community organizing and diplomatic efforts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox" id="accountability">
      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p class="nonfinalp">As the idea of the #HalftownMustGo campaign developed, participants discussed accountability in the relationships and processes around the effort. Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; and non-Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; participants in the initial meeting agreed on practices deemed by all present to be attentive to the nuances of cross-National collaboration, and specifically in accordance with the principles and values of the Two Row Wampum: mutual respect, peace, and friendship.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="textbox" id="moving-forward">
      <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
      <p>We view the U.S. federal government relating with the Council of Chiefs and Clan Mothers—instead of Halftown—both as a necessary immediate outcome and as only one step within broader processes of honoring the Two Row Wampum and addressing the ongoing impacts of settler colonialism. This campaign will close after Clint Halftown is no longer recognized by the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs, but organizers are committed to continuing to cultivate our relationships of care with Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; people and to continuing the work of holding fellow settlers and our governance processes accountable to the fact of ongoing Gayogo&#817;ho&#769;:n&#491;&#8311; sovereignty.
